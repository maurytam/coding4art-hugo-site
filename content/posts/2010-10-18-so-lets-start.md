I started writing on my personal blog 5 years ago, although i&#8217;ve never been a prolific blogger.  
I wrote 3 average posts per month, 1 average post per week, at least that&#8217;s what the SubText&#8217;s statistics say.

Now i think it&#8217;s time to change the language of my blog.  
In fact, from this post, i decided writing my posts in English, that is the main language on the Web, and therefore i will not write my posts in Italian anymore.

I hope to involve more readers than now, and meet people with whom to exchange views about developing about .Net technology, architecture and much more.

So, let&#8217;s start.
