In the extreme programming mailing list I read this topic that i carried over verbatim:

**<font size="2">If I had a common flaw I see in all recent projects is that there is more focus on analysis, has passed the message that the analysis is unnecessary and can be done during construction or not do at all. </font>**

I totally agree with this thought, that is independent from the application of each methodology, whatever you want
