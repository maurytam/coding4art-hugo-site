This is my second post about my Entity Framework Code First usage experience. You can find my first post <a href="http://www.coding4art.com/archive/2012/03/22/entity-framework-2ndashmy-scattered-notes-part-1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

<a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/72a60b14-1581-4b9b-89f2-846072eff19d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Entity Framework Power Tool</a> is a must-have tool for those who use EF in Code First mode, especially with fluent API. With this tool you can reverse-engineering an existing data source and then generate both domain classes (POCO) and the mapping configuration files. The latter are generated by creating a class which inherits from EntityConfiguration<T>, where T is your domain entity type. The tools is able to understand all the existing relations in the database and to transform them in the correct relation mapping in code.
